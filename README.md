# CMSE_401_Project
Semester-long project focused on implementing software onto the HPCC and 
parallelizing the software to decrease run time.

The current projected plan is to implement PyTorch that will
run a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm that learns how to beat Super Mario Bros Level 1

Project Proposal is located in `MariOh_Proposal.ipynb`

A getexample-esque for PyTorch is located in the `pytorch_classifier` folder
